The aim of the contest is to focus on analyzing customer behavior in online shopping. 
The dataset provided is from a US e-commerce platform from 2014 to 2018, and the task is to provide insights and recommendations to businesses based on economic theories.

The analysis includes a general overview of the dataset, such as product categories, geographical locations, seasonal trends, and shipping methods. Economic analysis covers the relationship between delivery time, profit/sales, and discounts, as well as policy analysis on price differentiation across states. The team also examines the elasticity of demand based on prices and predicts other relevant factors affecting purchase decisions.

All analysis is presented through visually appealing charts, tables, and maps, showcasing the team's ability to communicate complex economic theories through data analysis.

The recommendations provided are practical and feasible for businesses to implement, based on the team's thorough analysis of customer behavior. Overall, this repository serves as a valuable resource for businesses looking to improve their online sales strategies.
